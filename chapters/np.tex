\title{Nominal structures}


\abstract{This chapter shows how nominal structures are treated in HPSG. The introduction puts the discussion in the broader context of the NP vs.\ DP debate and differentiates three HPSG treatments: the specifier treatment, the DP treatment and the functor treatment. They are each presented in some detail and applied to the analysis of ordinary nominals. A comparison reveals that the DP treatment does not mesh as well with the monostratal surface-oriented nature of the HPSG framework as the other treatments. Then it is shown how the specifier treatment and the functor treatment deal with nominals that have idiosyncratic properties, such as the gerund, the Big Mess Construction and irregular P+NOM combinations.}

\section{Introduction}


I use the term \emph{nominal} in a broad and non-technical sense as standing 
for a noun and its phrasal projection. 
All of the bracketed strings in (\ref{rb}) are, hence, nominals. 

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{rb}  
{}[the [red [box]]] has disappeared
\end{exe} 
  
\noindent
The analysis of nominals continues to be a matter of debate. 
Advocates of the NP approach treat the noun as the head of the nominal, 
not only in \emph{red box} but also in \emph{the red box}. 
Advocates of the DP approach, by contrast, 
make a distinction between the nominal core, 
consisting of a noun with its complements and modifiers, if any,  
and a functional outer layer, comprising determiners, quantifiers and numerals. 
They, hence, treat the noun as the head of \emph{red box} and the determiner as
the head of \emph{the red box}, so that the category of \emph{the red box} is DP. 

The NP approach remained unchallenged throughout the first decades of generative 
grammar. The Government and Binding\indexgb model \citep{Chomsky81}, for instance, 
employed the phrase structure rule in (\ref{ps0}). 

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{ps0}     NP ~ $\rightarrow$ ~ Det ~ Nom
\end{exe}

\noindent
Phrase structure rules were required to ``meet some variety of X-bar theory'' \citep[5]{Chomsky81}. 
The original variety is that of \citet{Chomsky70}. It consists of the following
cross-categorial rule schemata:

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{xbar} 
\begin{xlist} 
\ex\label{xbar1}   X$'$ ~ $\rightarrow$ ~ X ~  \ldots
\ex\label{xbar2}   X$''$ ~ $\rightarrow$ ~ [Spec, X$'$] ~ X$'$ 
\end{xlist} 
\end{exe} 

\largerpage
\noindent
X$'$ stands for the combination of a head and its complements,
where X is N, A or V, and X$''$ stands for the combination of 
X$'$ and its specifier ``where \mbox{[Spec,N$'$]} will be analyzed as the determiner'' 
\citep[210]{Chomsky70}. 
X-bar theory was further developed in \citet{Jackendoff77}, who added a
schema for the addition of adjuncts and who extended the range of 
X with P, the category of adpositions. A monostratal version of X-bar theory is 
developed in Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG). Its application to nominals 
is exemplified in Figure~\ref{sis}, quoted from \citet[126]{GPSG85}. 
The top node is the double-bar category N$''$, which 
consists of the determiner and the single-bar category N$'$. 
The AP and the relative clause (S[+R]) are adjoined to N$'$, and 
the lowest N$'$ consists of the noun and its PP complement.

      [{S[+R]} [who we met,roof]]]]]
\end{forest}
\caption{\label{sis}An instance of the NP approach} 
\end{figure}
 
The DP approach results from an extension of the range of X in (\ref{xbar}) 
to the functional categories. This was motivated by the fact that some of 
the phrase structure rules, such as (\ref{ps1}), do not fit the X-bar mould. 

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{ps1}   S ~ $\rightarrow$ ~ NP ~ Aux ~ VP
\end{exe}   

\noindent
To repair this, the category Aux, which contained both auxiliaries and 
inflectional verbal affixes \citep{Chomsky57}, was renamed as I(nfl) and treated as the head of S. 
More specifically, I(nfl) was claimed to combine with a VP complement, yielding I$'$, 
and I$'$ was claimed to combine with an NP specifier (the subject), yielding I$''$
(formerly S).
For the analysis of nominals such an overhaul did not at first seem necessary, 
since the relevant PS rules did fit the X-bar mould, but it took place nonetheless, 
mainly in order to capture similarities between nominal and clausal structures. 
These are especially conspicuous in gerunds, nominalized infinitives and nominals 
with a deverbal head, and were seen as evidence for the claim that determiners have their 
own phrasal projection, just like the members of I(nfl) \citep{Abney87}. 
More specifically, members of D were claimed to take an N$''$ complement, 
yielding D$'$, and D$'$ was claimed to have a potentially empty specifier sister, 
as in Figure~\ref{abn}. The DP approach was also taken on board in other frameworks, 
such as Word Grammar \citep{Hudson90} and Lexical Functional Grammar \citep[99]{Bresnan00}.

\end{forest}

\end{figure}

\largerpage     
Turning now to Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, we find three different treatments.  
The first and oldest can be characterized as a lexicalist version of the NP approach, 
more specifically of its monostratal formulation in GPSG, see 
\citew[Sections 4.4 and 5.7]{ps}, \citew[Sections 1.7 to 1.9 and 9.4]{ps2}, 
\citew[189--195]{GS00} and \citew{MyPM2021a}. I henceforth call it the \emph{specifier treatment}, 
after the role which it assigns to the determiner. 
The second is a lexicalist version of the DP approach.  
It is first proposed in \citet{Netter94} and further developed in \citet{Netter96a}
and \citet{NerbonneMullen00}. I will call it the \emph{DP treatment}. 
The third adopts the NP approach, but neutralizes the distinction between adjuncts and specifiers, 
treating them both as functors. It is first proposed in \citet{VanEynde98a} and 
\citet{Allegranza98} and further developed in \citet{VanEynde03}, \citet{VanEynde06} 
and \citet{Allegranza06}. It is also adopted in Sign-Based Construction Grammar
(\citealp[Section~8.4]{Sag2012}.\footnote{On SBCG in general, see \crossrefchapteralp[Section~\ref{sec-sbcg}]{cxg}.} 
I will call it the \emph{functor treatment}. This chapter presents the three treatments and 
compares them wherever this seems appropriate.  

I first focus on ordinary nominals (Section~\ref{ordi}) and then on nominals with idiosyncratic 
properties (Section~\ref{idio}). For exemplification I use \ili{English} and a number of other \ili{Germanic} 
and \ili{Romance} languages, including \ili{Dutch}, \ili{German}, \ili{Italian} and \ili{French}.  
I assume familiarity with the typed feature description notation and with such basic notions 
as inheritance and token-identity; see \crossrefchaptert{formal-background} 
and \crossrefchaptert{properties}.\footnote{This chapter does not treat relative clauses,
since they are the topic of a separate chapter \crossrefchapterp{relative-clauses}.}
    
\section{Ordinary nominals} 
\label{ordi} 

%\largerpage[2]
I use the term \emph{ordinary nominal} for a nominal that contains a noun, 
any number of complements and/or adjuncts and at most one determiner. 
This section shows how such nominals are analyzed in the 
specifier treatment (Section~\ref{spect}), the DP treatment (Section~\ref{dpt}) and 
the functor treatment (Section~\ref{funct}). 

    
\subsection{The specifier treatment} 
\label{spect}\label{np:sec-specifier-analysis}


The specifier treatment adopts the same distinction between heads, complements, 
specifiers and adjuncts as X-bar theory, but its integration 
in a monostratal lexicalist framework inevitably leads to non-trivial differences,
as will be demonstrated in this section. 
The presentation is mainly based on \citet{ps2} and \citet{GS00}. 
I first discuss the syntactic structure (Section~\ref{syns}) and the semantic composition (Section~\ref{semco}) 
of nominals, and then turn to nominals with a phrasal specifier (Section~\ref{phrsp}). 


\subsubsection{Syntactic structure}
\label{syns} 

Continuing with the same example as in Figure~\ref{abn}, 
a relational noun, such as \emph{sister}, selects a PP as its complement 
and a determiner as its specifier, as spelled out in 
the following \textsc{category} value:  

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{n}
\avm{
[\type*{category} \\
head & noun \\
spr & < Det > \\
comps & < PP![\type{of}\,]! > ]
}
\end{exe}

\noindent
The combination with a matching PP
is subsumed by the \type{head-complements-phrase} type, 
and yields a nominal with an empty \textsc{comps} list (see also
\crossrefchapteralt[Section~\ref{properties:sec-hierarchy-of-phrase-types}]{properties} on 
structures of type \emph{head"=complements"=phrase}).  
Similarly, the combination of this nominal with a matching determiner
is subsumed by the \type{head-specifier-phrase} type,
and yields a nominal with an empty \textsc{spr} list, as spelled out in Figure~\ref{les}. 

\begin{figure}

\begin{forest}

			[%
			\avm{[head \1, spr < \2 >, comps < \3 > ]}
				[sister]
			]
			[\ibox{3} PP [of Leslie,roof]]]]	
\end{forest}
\caption{\label{les} Adnominal complements and specifiers}
\end{figure}

Since the noun is the head of \emph{sister of Leslie} and since \emph{sister of Leslie} is 
the head of \emph{that sister of Leslie}, the Head Feature Principle\is{principle!Head Feature}\footnote{%
See \citet[34]{ps2} and \crossrefchaptert[Section~\ref{properties:sec-hierarchy-of-phrase-types}]{properties}.
} implies that the phrase as a whole shares the \textsc{head} value of the noun \iboxb{1}. 
The valence features, \textsc{comps} and \textsc{spr}, have a double role. 
On the one hand, they register the degree of saturation of the nominal; 
in this role they supersede the bar levels of X-bar theory. 
On the other hand, they capture co-occurrence restrictions, 
such as the fact that the complement of \emph{sister} is a PP, rather than an NP or a clause.

In contrast to complements and specifiers, adjuncts are not selected by their 
head sister. Instead, they are treated as selectors of their head sisters. 
To model this, \citet[55--57]{ps2} employ the feature \textsc{mod(ified)}. 
It is part of the \textsc{head} value of the substantive parts-of-speech, 
i.e.\ noun, verb, adjective and adposition. Its value is of type \type{synsem} 
in the case of adjuncts and of type \type{none} otherwise.

\begin{exe} 
\ex   \type{substantive}: \avm{[mod & synsem $\vee$ none]}
\end{exe} 

\noindent
Attributive adjectives, for instance, select a nominal head sister 
which requires a specifier, as spelled out in (\ref{rd}). 

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{rd}
\avm{
[\type*{category}
head &	[\type*{adjective}
		mod|loc|category &	[head & noun \\
                         	spr & nelist] ] ]
}
\end{exe}

\noindent
The token-identity of the \textsc{mod(ified)} value of the adjective
with the \textsc{synsem} value of its head sister is part of the 
definition of the type \type{head-adjunct-phrase} \citep[Section~\ref{properties:sec-hierarchy-of-phrase-types}]{chapters/properties}. 
The requirement that the \textsc{spr} value of the selected nominal be a non-empty list
blocks the addition of adjectives to nominals which contain a 
determiner, as in *\emph{tall that bridge}.\footnote{This constraint is 
overruled in the Big Mess Construction, see Section~\ref{bime}.} 
Since the \textsc{mod(ified)} feature is part of the \textsc{head} value, 
it follows from the Head Feature Principle\is{principle!Head Feature} that it is shared between an adjective 
and the AP which it projects. As a consequence, the \textsc{mod(ified)} value of 
\emph{very tall} is shared with that of \emph{tall}, as shown in Figure~\ref{lea}. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{forest}

\end{forest}
\caption{\label{lea} Adnominal modifiers}
\end{figure}
 
For languages in which attributive adjectives show number and gender agreement 
with the nouns they modify, the selected nominal is required to have specific 
number and gender values. The \ili{Italian} \emph{grossa} `big', for instance, 
selects a singular feminine nominal and is, hence, compatible with a noun like 
\emph{scatola} `box', but not with the plural \emph{scatole} `boxes' nor with 
the masculine \emph{libro} `book' or \emph{libri} `books'.\footnote{This is an 
instance of concord \crossrefchapterp[Section~\ref{agreement-sec-index-concord}]{agreement}.}  


\subsubsection{Semantic composition}
\label{semco} 


Semantic representations in HPSG
do not constitute a separate level of representation, but take the form 
of attribute value pairs that are added to the syntactic representations.   
Phrase formation and semantic composition are, hence, modeled in tandem.  
Technically, the \textsc{content} feature is declared for the same type of objects 
as the \textsc{category} feature, as spelled out in (\ref{local}). 

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{local}  \type{local}: \avm{[category & category \\
                        		content & semantic-object] } 
\end{exe} 

\noindent 
In the case of nominals, the value of the \textsc{content} feature is of 
type \type{scope-object}, a subtype of \type{semantic-object} \citep[122]{GS00}. 
A scope-object is an index-restriction pair in which the index stands for 
entities and the restriction is a set of facts which constrain the 
denotation of the index, as in the \textsc{content} value of the noun \emph{box}:    

\ea\label{red} 
\avm{
[\type*{scope-object}
 index & \1 \type{index} \\
 restr & \{[\type*{box}
            arg & \1 ]\}]
} 
\z

\noindent
This is comparable to the representations which are canonically used in 
Predicate Logic (PL), such as \{\,x\,$|$\,\type{box}(x)\,\}, where x stands for 
the entities that the predicate \emph{box} applies to. In contrast to 
PL variables, HPSG indices are sorted with respect to person, number 
and gender. This provides the means to model the type of agreement that 
is called \emph{index agreement} \crossrefchapterp[Section~\ref{agreement-sec-index-concord}]{agreement}.

\begin{exe} 
\ex  \type{index}: \avm{
                     [person & person \\
                      number & number \\
                      gender & gender] } 
\end{exe} 

\textsc{content} values of attributive adjectives are also of type \type{scope-object}. 
When combined with a noun, as in \emph{red box}, the resulting representation 
is one in which the indices of the adjective and the noun are identical, as in 
(\ref{redbox}).\footnote{This is an example of intersective modification. 
The semantic contribution of other types of adjectives, such as  
\emph{alleged} and \emph{fake}, are modeled differently \citep[330--331]{ps2}. See also
\crossrefchaptert[Section~\ref{semantics-sec-adjunct-scope}]{semantics}.}   

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{redbox} 
\avm{
[\type*{scope-object}     \\
 index & \1                \\
 restr & \{ [\type{red}    \\
             arg & \1 ],
            [\type{box}  \\
             arg & \1 ]\}]
}
\end{exe}

\noindent
Also this is comparable to the PL practice of representing such 
combinations with one variable to which both predicates apply, as in 
\{\,x\,$|$\,\type{red}(x) \& \type{box}(x)\,\}. What triggers the index sharing is 
the \textsc{mod(ified)} value of the adjective, as illustrated by the AVM of 
\emph{red} in (\ref{reddd}) \citep[55]{ps2}.
% \footnote{Boxed Greek capitals
% are used to indicate structure sharing for objects of 
% type \type{set} \citep[\page 23]{GS00}.} 

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{reddd}
\avm{
[\punk{category|head}{	[\type*{adjective}
						mod|loc|content	[\type*{scope-object}
										index & \1 \\
										restr & \2 ] ]} \\
content &	[index & \1 \\
			restr &	\{[\type*{red}
					arg & \1 ]\} \cupAVM \2 ] ]
}
\end{exe}

\noindent
The adjective selects a \type{synsem} whose \textsc{content} value is a scope-object, 
shares its index and adds its restriction to those of the \type{synsem} it selects. 
The resulting \textsc{content} value is then shared with the mother.

\begin{sloppypar}
To model the semantic contribution of determiners, \citet[135--136]{GS00} 
make a distinction between scope-objects that contain a quantifier 
(\type{quant-rel}), and those that do not (\type{parameter}). 
The addition of a quantifying determiner to a nominal, 
as in \emph{every red box}, triggers a shift from \type{parameter} to \type{quant-rel}. 
To capture this shift, the specifier treatment employs the feature \textsc{spec(ified)}. 
It is part of the \textsc{head} value of determiners, and its value is of type 
\type{semantic-object} \citep[362]{GS00}.\footnote{In \citet[45]{ps2} the \textsc{spec(ified)}
feature was also assigned to other function words, such as complementizers, 
and its value was of type \type{synsem}.}   
\end{sloppypar}

\begin{exe} 
\ex   \type{determiner}: \avm{[spec & semantic-object]}
\end{exe} 

\noindent
In the case of \emph{every}, the \textsc{spec} value is an object of 
type \type{parameter}, but its own \textsc{content} value is a subtype of 
\type{quant-rel} and this quantifier is put in store, to be retrieved 
at the place where its scope is determined, as illustrated by the AVM
of \emph{every} in (\ref{every}) \citep[204]{GS00}.  

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{every} 
\avm{
[\punk{category|head}{	[\type*{determiner}
						spec	[\type*{parameter}
								index & \1 \\
								restr & \2 ] ]} \\
content & \3 [\type*{every-rel}
             index & \1 \\
             restr & \2 ] \\
store & \{ \3 \} ]
}
\end{exe}

\noindent 
Notice that the addition of the \textsc{spec} feature yields an analysis in which the determiner 
and the nominal select each other: the nominal selects 
its specifier by means of the valence feature \textsc{spr} and the determiner selects 
the semantic content of the nominal by means of \textsc{spec}.  


\subsubsection{Nominals with a phrasal specifier} 
\label{phrsp}


Specifiers of nominals tend to be single words, but they can also take the form 
of a phrase. The bracketed phrase in [\emph{the Queen of England's}] \emph{sister},
for instance, is in complementary distribution with the possessive
determiner in \emph{her sister} and has a comparable semantic contribution.   
For this reason it is treated along the same lines. More specifically, the 
possessive marker\,\emph{'s} is treated as a determiner that takes an NP as its specifier, 
as shown in Figure~\ref{cousin} \citep[51--54]{ps2} and \citep[193]{GS00}.\footnote{\label{fn-possesive-s}The treatment 
of the phonologically reduced \emph{'s} as the head of a phrase is comparable to 
the treatment of the homophonous word in \emph{he's ill} as the head of a VP.
Notice that the possessive \emph{'s} is not a genitive affix, for if it were, it 
would be affixed to the head noun \emph{Queen}, as in *\emph{the Queen's of England sister} (see  
\citealt*[199]{SagWasow03}).}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{forest}
sm edges

		[sister]
	]
]
\end{forest}
\caption{\label{cousin} A phrasal specifier }  
\end{figure}

In this analysis, the specifier of \emph{sister} is a DetP that is headed by\,\emph{'s},  
which in turn takes the NP \emph{the Queen of England} as its specifier.\footnote{Since the 
specifier of \emph{'s} is an NP, it may in turn contain a specifier that is headed 
by \emph{'s}, as in \emph{John's uncle's car}.}
Semantically, \emph{'s} relates the index of its specifier (the possessor) to the index
of the nominal that it selects (the possessed), as spelled out in (\ref{poss}).\footnote{The
terms \emph{possessor} and \emph{possessed} are meant to be understood in a broad, not-too-literal 
sense \citep[\page 8--9]{Nerbonne92}.}     

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{poss}
\avm{
[category &	[head &	[\type*{determiner}
					spec &	[\type*{parameter}
							index & \1 \\
							restr & \2 ] ] \\
			spr &	<[index & \3]> ] \\

				index & \1 \\
				restr & \{[\type*{poss-rel}
                          possessor & \3 \\
                          possessed & \1 ]\} \cupAVM \2 ] \\
store & \{ \4 \} ]  
}
\end{exe}

\noindent
The assignment of \type{the-rel} as the \textsc{content} value captures 
the definiteness of the resulting NP. Notice that this analysis contains a DetP, 
but in spite of that, it is not an instance of the DP approach, since the 
determiner does not head the nominal as a whole, but only its specifier. 


\subsection{The DP treatment} 
\label{dpt} 


An HPSG version of the DP approach has been developed in \citet{Netter94} and 
\citet{Netter96a}. I sketch the main characteristics of this treatment in Section~\ref{compl}
and discuss some problems for it in Section~\ref{prob}. 


\subsubsection{Functional complementation and functional completeness} 
\label{compl} 


The combination of a noun with its complements and its adjuncts is analyzed in much the 
same way as in the specifier treatment. The addition of the determiner, though, is modeled differently.  
It is not the nominal that selects the determiner as its specifier, but rather the determiner that 
selects the nominal as its complement.
More specifically, it selects the nominal by means of the valence feature \textsc{comps} and the 
result of the combination is a DP with an empty \textsc{comps} list, as in Figure~\ref{net}.  

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{forest}

{[\head \ibox{1} \type{det}, \comps \eliste ]}

	[%

		[%
		{[\head \ibox{2}, \comps \sliste{ \ibox{3} } ]}
			[sister]
		]
		[\ibox{3} PP [of Leslie, roof]]]]
\end{forest}
\caption{\label{net} Propagation of the \textsc{head} and \textsc{comps} values}
\end{figure}

In this analysis there is no need for the valence feature \textsc{spr} in the NP.  
This looks like a gain, but in practice it is offset by the 
introduction of a distinction between functional 
complementation and ordinary complementation. To model it, \citet[307--308]{Netter94} differentiates 
between major and minor \textsc{head} features: 

\begin{exe} 
\ex    \avm{
       [head [major & [n & boolean   \\
                       v & boolean ] \\
              \punk{minor|fcompl}{boolean} ] ]
       } 
\end{exe} 

\noindent
The \textsc{major} attribute includes the boolean features N and V, where 
nouns are [+N, --V], adjectives [+N, +V], verbs [--N, +V] and adpositions [--N, --V]. 
Besides, [+N] categories also have the features \textsc{case}, \textsc{number} and \textsc{gender}. 
Typical of functional complementation is that the functional head shares the 
\textsc{major} value of its complement, as specified in (\ref{maj}). 

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{maj} Functional Complementation: In a lexical category of type \type{func-cat} the value of its \textsc{major} 
      attribute is token identical with the \textsc{major} value of its complement \citep[311--312]{Netter94}.  
\end{exe} 

\noindent
Since determiners are of type \type{func-cat}, they share the \textsc{major} value of their 
nominal complement, and since that value is 
also shared with the DP (given the Head Feature Principle\is{principle!Head Feature}), it follows that the resulting 
DP is [+N,--V] and that its \textsc{case}, \textsc{number} and \textsc{gender} values are 
identical to those of its nominal non-head daughter. 
Nouns, by contrast, are not of type \type{func-cat} and, hence, do not share the 
\textsc{major} value of their complement. The noun \emph{sister} 
in Figure~\ref{net}, for instance, does not share the part-of-speech of its PP complement. 

The \textsc{minor} attribute is used to model properties which a functional head 
does {\em not} share with its complement. It includes \textsc{fcompl}, a feature which 
registers whether a projection is functionally complete or not. Its value is positive for 
determiners, negative for singular count nouns and underspecified for plurals and mass nouns.  
Determiners take a nominal complement with a negative \textsc{fcompl} value, but their 
own \textsc{fcompl} value is positive, and since they are the head, they share this value with 
the mother, as in Figure~\ref{netter}.

In this analysis, a nominal is complete if it is both saturated 
(empty \textsc{comps} list) and functionally complete (positive \textsc{fcompl}), as 
spelled out in (\ref{min}) \citep[312]{Netter94}.

\subsubsection{Two problems for the DP treatment}  
\label{prob}

\largerpage
Given the definition of functional complementation in (\ref{maj}), 
determiners share the \textsc{major} value of the nominals which they select
and are, hence, nominal themselves, i.e.\ [+N, --V].
However, while this makes sense for determiners with (pro)nominal properties,
such as the \ili{English} demonstrative \emph{that}, 
it is rather implausible for determiners with adjectival properties,
such as the \ili{German} interrogative \emph{welch-} `which' and 
the \ili{Italian} demonstrative \emph{questo} `this', which show the same variation for 
number, gender and case as the adjectives and which are subject to 
the same requirement on concord with the noun as adnominal adjectives. 
Since such determiners have more in common with adjectives than with (pro)nouns,  
it would be more plausible to treat them as members of [+N, +V].  

The problem also affects the associated agreement features, i.e.\ \textsc{case}, 
\textsc{number} and \textsc{gender}. If a determiner 
is required to share the values of these features with its nominal complement,
as spelled out in (\ref{maj}), then one gets implausible results for nominals in 
which the determiner and the noun do not show agreement.    
In the \ili{Dutch} \emph{'s lands hoogste bergen} `the country's highest mountains', 
for instance, the selected nominal (\emph{hoogste bergen}) is plural and non-genitive, 
while the selecting determiner (\emph{'s lands}) is singular and genitive.  
The assumption that the determiner shares the case and number of its nominal sister 
is, hence, problematic.
% \itdblue{The genitive NP usually does not select an NP. So one needs a pumping rule and this rule
%   licenses something that can agree in case with the rest of the NP since its case value is undetermined.}
% \itdblue{It does in Netter's treatment. The problem is avoided if one postulates an empty D 
% that takes the genitive as its specifier and that otherwise shares the properties of its 
% NP complement, but that is not what Netter proposes. In fact, he explicitly makes a point of avoiding 
% empty D's.}

Another problem concerns the assumption ``that all substantive categories will 
require the complement they combine with to be both saturated and functionally complete''
\citep[311]{Netter94}. Complements of verbs and adpositions must, hence, be positively 
specified for \textsc{fcompl}. This is contradicted by the existence of
adpositions which require their complement to be functionally incomplete. 
The \ili{Dutch} \emph{te} and \emph{per}, for instance, require a determinerless nominal,
even if the nominal is singular and count, as in \emph{te (*het) paard} `on horse' 
and \emph{per (*de) trein} `by train'. A reviewer points out that this is 
not necessarily a problem for the DP approach, but only for Netter's version of it. 
Technically, it may indeed suffice to drop the erroneous assumption, but 
conceptually the existence of adpositions which require a determinerless nominal 
does suggest that the NP approach is more plausible, especially since 
there are no adpositions (nor verbs) which require a nounless nominal.\footnote{NP 
treatments of adpositions with a determinerless nominal are provided in 
\citet{VanEynde04} for \ili{Dutch} and in \citet{Kiss2008a-u} for \ili{German}.}    


\subsection{The functor treatment} 
\label{funct}\label{np:sec-functor-treatment}

\largerpage\enlargethispage{3pt}
The functor treatment adopts the NP approach, but in contrast to the specifier treatment,  
it does not model specification and adjunction in different terms, and it does not adopt 
the distinction between substantive (or lexical) categories and functional 
categories.\footnote{The term \emph{functor} is also used in Categorial (Unification) Grammar, 
where it has a very broad meaning, subsuming the non-head daughter in combinations of a 
head with a specifier or an adjunct, and the head daughter otherwise;
see \citet{Bouma88}. This broad notion is also adopted in 
\citet{Reape94}. I adopt a more restrictive version in which functors 
are non-head daughters which lexically select their head sister. For a general comparison of
HPSG and Categorial Grammar see also \crossrefchapterw{cg}.}  
The presentation in this section is mainly based on \citet{VanEynde06} 
and \citet{Allegranza06}. I first discuss the motivation which underlies the adoption 
of the functor treatment (Section~\ref{motiv}) and then present its basic
properties (Section~\ref{sec-basics}). I then turn to nominals with a 
phrasal specifier (Section~\ref{sec-phrasal-spec}) 
and to the hierarchy of \textsc{marking} values (Section~\ref{sec-without-spec}).    


\subsubsection{Motivation} 
\label{motiv}


The distinction between specifiers and adjuncts is usually motivated by 
the assumption that the former are obligatory and non-stackable, while the latter  
are optional and stackable. In practice, though, this distinction 
is blurred by the fact that many nominals are well-formed without a specifier.
Bare plurals and singular mass nouns, for instance, are routinely used without a 
specifier in \ili{English}, and many other languages allow singular count nouns without 
a specifier too. The claim that specifiers are obligatory is, hence, to be taken 
with a large pinch of salt. The same holds for their non-stackability. 
\ili{Italian} possessives, for instance, are routinely preceded by an article, as in 
\emph{il nostro futuro} `the our future' and \emph{un mio amico} `a friend of mine'.     
This is also true for the \ili{Greek} demonstratives, which are canonically preceded by the 
definite article. \ili{English}, too, has examples of this kind, as in \emph{his every wish}.    

Similar remarks apply to the distinction between lexical and functional categories. 
This distinction plays a prominent role in the specifier and the DP treatment, both of which treat 
determiners as members of a separate functional category Det, that is distinct from 
such lexical categories as N, Adj and Adv.
In practice, though, it turns out that the class of determiners is quite heterogeneous in 
terms of part-of speech. \citet{VanEynde06}, for instance, demonstrates that the 
\ili{Dutch} determiners come in (at least) two kinds. On the one hand, there are those 
which show the same inflectional variation and the same concord with the noun as 
prenominal adjectives: they take the affix \emph{-e} in combination with plural 
and singular non-neuter nominals, but not in combination with singular 
neuter nominals, as shown for the adjective \emph{zwart} `black' in (\ref{wit}), 
for the possessive determiner \emph{ons} `our' in (\ref{ons}) and for the 
interrogative determiner \emph{welk} `which' in (\ref{welk}).\footnote{If the adjective 
is preceded by a definite determiner, 
it also takes the affix in singular neuter nominals. This phenomenon is treated 
in Section~\ref{sec-without-spec}.} 

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{wit} 
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll  zwarte muren      \\
      black wall.\textsc{pl} \\\hfill(\ili{Dutch})
\ex
\gll  zwarte verf \\
      black paint.\textsc{sg.f} \\
\ex
\gll  zwart zand \\
      black sand.\textsc{sg.n} \\
\end{xlist}
\ex\label{ons}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll onze ouders     \\
     our parent.\textsc{pl}  \\
\ex
\gll onze muur     \\
     our wall.\textsc{sg.m}  \\
\ex
\gll ons huis     \\
     our house.\textsc{sg.n}  \\
\end{xlist}
\ex\label{welk}
\begin{xlist} 
\ex
\gll welke boeken  \\
     which book.\textsc{pl} \\
\ex
\gll welke man                 \\
     which man.\textsc{sg.m}  \\
\ex
\gll welk boek   \\
     which book.\textsc{sg.n} \\
\end{xlist}
\end{exe} 

\noindent
On the other hand, there are determiners which are inflectionally invariant and which do 
do not show concord with the noun, such as the interrogative \emph{wiens} `whose' 
and the quantifier \emph{wat} `some'. 

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{wiens}
\begin{xlist} 
\ex
\gll  wiens ouders \\ 
      whose parent.\textsc{pl} \\\hfill(\ili{Dutch})
\ex
\gll  wiens muur \\ 
      whose wall.\textsc{sg.m} \\
\ex
\gll  wiens huis \\ 
      whose house.\textsc{sg.n} \\
\end{xlist}
\ex\label{wat}
\begin{xlist}
\ex
\gll  wat boeken  \\
      some book.\textsc{pl} \\
\ex
\gll  wat verf                  \\
      some paint.\textsc{sg.f} \\
\ex
\gll  wat zand  \\
      some sand.\textsc{sg.n} \\
\end{xlist} 
\end{exe} 

\noindent
In that respect, they are like nouns that appear in prenominal position,
as in \emph{aluminium tafels} `aluminum tables' and \emph{de maximum lengte}
`the maximum length'. There are, hence, determiners with adjectival 
properties and determiners with nominal properties.   
The distinction is also relevant for other languages. The \ili{Italian} 
possessives of the first and second person, for instance, 
show the same alternation for number and gender as adjectives
and are subject to the same constraints on NP-internal concord, as illustrated 
for \emph{nostro} `our' in (\ref{nostr}). 

\begin{exe}  
\ex\label{nostr} 
\begin{xlist}
\ex 
\gll  il nostro futuro \\
      the our future.\textsc{sg.m} \\\hfill(\ili{Italian}) 
\ex 
\gll  la nostra scuola  \\
      the our school.\textsc{sg.f} \\ 
\ex 
\gll  i nostri genitori \\
      the our parent.\textsc{pl.m} \\ 
\ex 
\gll  le nostre scatole \\
      the our box.\textsc{pl.f} \\ 
\end{xlist}
\end{exe} 

\noindent
By contrast, the possessive of the third person plural, \emph{loro} `their',
does not show any inflectional variation and does not show concord with the noun.

\begin{exe} 
\ex 
\begin{xlist}
\ex 
\gll  il loro futuro \\   
      the their future.\textsc{sg.m}  \\\hfill(\ili{Italian}) 
\ex 
\gll  la loro scuola  \\   
      the their school.\textsc{sg.f}   \\ 
\ex 
\gll  i loro genitori \\   
      the their parent.\textsc{pl.m} \\ 
\ex 
\gll  le loro scatole \\   
      the their box.\textsc{pl.f} \\ 
\end{xlist} 
\end{exe}

\noindent
Confirming evidence for the distinction between adjectival and pronominal possessives
is provided by the fact that \emph{loro} is also used as a personal pronoun, 
whereas the other possessives are not.\footnote{In this context one has to use 
the pronoun \emph{noi} `us' instead.} 

\begin{exe} 
\ex 
\gll   Enrico ha  dato  una scatola a  loro /  *  nostro. \\
       Enrico has given a   box     to them {} {} our     \\\hfill(\ili{Italian}) 
\trans `Enrico gave them a box.'
\end{exe} 

\largerpage
\noindent
There are also determiners with adverbial properties. 
\citet*{Abeilleetal04}, for instance, 
assign adverbial status to the quantifying determiner in the \ili{French} 
\emph{beaucoup de farine} `much flour', and the same could be argued 
for such determiners as the \ili{English} \emph{enough} and its 
\ili{Dutch} equivalent \emph{genoeg}. 
In sum, there is evidence that the class of determiners is categorially 
heterogeneous and that a treatment which acknowledges this is potentially 
simpler and less stipulative than one which introduces a separate functional 
category for them. 
 

\subsubsection{Basics} 
\label{sec-basics}\label{np:sec-functor-basics}


Technically, the elimination of the distinction between specifiers and adjuncts
means that the \textsc{spr} feature is dropped.
Likewise, the elimination of the distinction between lexical and 
functional categories means that there is no longer any need 
for separate selection features for them; \textsc{mod(ified)} and \textsc{spec(ified)}
are dropped and replaced by the more general \textsc{select}.  
To spell out the functor treatment in more detail, I start from the 
hierarchy of headed phrases in Figure~\ref{typ}. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{forest}
%sm edges

[headed-phrase
	[head-argument-phrase
		[head-comps-phr]

		[head-functor-phr]
		[head-indep-phr]]]	
\end{forest}
\caption{\label{typ} Hierarchy of headed phrases}
\end{figure}

\largerpage
The basic distinction is
the one between \type{head-argument-phrase} and \type{head"=nonargument"=phrase}. 
In head-argument phrases, the head daughter selects its non-head sister(s) by means of 
valence features, such as \textsc{comps} and \textsc{subj} (but not \textsc{spr}!), 
and it is their values that register the degree of saturation of the phrase, 
as shown for \textsc{comps} in Section~\ref{syns}.  
In head-nonargument phrases, the degree of saturation is registered  
by the \textsc{marking} feature. It is declared for objects of type \type{category}, 
along with the \textsc{head} and valence features.\footnote{The \textsc{marking} feature  
is introduced in \citet[46]{ps2} to model the combination of a complementizer 
and a clause.} Its value is shared with the head daughter in head-argument phrases
and with the non-head daughter in head-nonargument phrases, as spelled out in 
(\ref{mark1}) and (\ref{mark2}) respectively. 

\ea\label{mark1}

}
% avm todo
\z

\noindent
At a finer-grained level, there is a distinction between two subtypes of 
\type{head-nonargument-phrase}. There is the type, called \type{head-functor-phrase},  
in which the non-head daughter selects its head sister. This selection is modeled 
by the \textsc{select} feature. Its value is an object of type \type{synsem} and is 
required to match the \textsc{synsem} value of the head daughter, as spelled out 
in (\ref{hefu}).  

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{hefu} 
\type{head-functor-phrase} \impl \\
\avm{
[dtrs & <[synsem|loc|category|head|select & \1], [synsem & \1 ]>] 
}
\end{exe} 

\noindent
The other subtype, called \type{head-independent-phrase}, subsumes combinations in 
which the non-head daughter does not select its head sister.\footnote{This type is 
introduced in \citet[130]{VanEynde98a}. It will be used in Section~\ref{idio} to deal with 
idiosyncratic nominals, such as the Big Mess Construction and the Binominal Noun Phrase 
Construction.} In that case the \textsc{select} value of the non-head daughter is of type 
\type{none}, as spelled out in (\ref{hein}). 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{hein} 
\type{head-independent-phrase} \impl \\
\avm{
[dtrs & <[synsem|loc|category|head|select & none], X >]

\end{forest}}
\caption{\label{markyy} Marking and selection in nominal projections}
\end{figure}

An illustration of the functor treatment is given in Figure~\ref{markyy}.
The combination of the noun with the adjective is an instance of \type{head-functor-phrase}, 
in which the adjective selects an unmarked nominal \iboxb{3},  
shares its \textsc{marking} value \iboxb{5}, and, being a nonargument, 
shares it with the mother as well. 
The combination of the resulting nominal with the demonstrative is also 
an instance of \type{head-functor-phrase},
in which the demonstrative selects an unmarked nominal \iboxb{4}, 
but -- differently from the adjective -- its \textsc{marking} value is of type 
\type{marked}, and this value is shared with the mother \iboxb{2}.    
This accounts for the ill-formedness of 
*\emph{long that bridge} and *\emph{the that bridge}, since 
adnominal adjectives and articles are not compatible with a marked nominal.  
Whether an adnominal functor is marked or unmarked is subject to cross-linguistic variation. 
The \ili{Italian} possessives, for instance, are unmarked and can, hence, be preceded 
by an article, as in \emph{il mio cane} `the my dog', but   
their \ili{French} equivalents are marked: \emph{(*le) mon chien} `(*the) my dog'. 

In this treatment, determiners are marked selectors of an unmarked nominal. 
Since this definition does not make reference to a specific part-of-speech, 
it is well-equipped to deal with the categorial heterogeneity of the determiners. 
The \ili{English} demonstrative \emph{that}, for instance, 
can be treated as a pronoun, not only when it is used in nominal position, as in 
\emph{I like that}, but also when it is used adnominally, as in \emph{I like that bike}.   
What captures the difference between these uses is not the part-of-speech but  
the \textsc{select} value: while the adnominal \emph{that} selects an unmarked nominal, 
its nominal counterpart does not select anything.      

        
\subsubsection{Nominals with a phrasal functor} 
\label{sec-phrasal-spec}


To illustrate how the treatment outlined in the previous section deals with phrasal functors, I
take the nominal \emph{a hundred pages}. Since the indefinite article is not 
compatible with a plural noun like \emph{pages} I assume that this phrase  
has a left branching structure in which the indefinite article selects 
the unmarked singular noun \emph{hundred} -- its plural counterpart is \emph{hundreds} --  
and in which the resulting NP selects the unmarked plural noun 
\emph{pages}, as spelled out in Figure~\ref{glorie}. 
 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\oneline{%
\begin{forest}
sm edges
[%
{[\head \ibox{1} \type{noun}, \textsc{mark} \ibox{2}]}
	[%
	{[\head \ibox{4} [\type{noun}, \textsc{sel} \ibox{3}], \textsc{mark} \ibox{2}]}
		[%
		{[\textsc{head|sel} \ibox{5}, \textsc{mark} \ibox{2} \type{marked}\,]}
			[a]
		]
		[%
		{\ibox{5} [\head \ibox{4}, \textsc{mark} \type{unmarked}\,]}
			[hundred]
		]
	]
	[%
	{\ibox{3} [\head \ibox{1}, \textsc{mark} \type{unmarked}\,]}
		[pages]
	]
]
\end{forest}}
\caption{\label{glorie} A phrasal functor}
\end{figure}

The \textsc{head} value of the entire NP is identified with that 
of \emph{pages} \iboxb{1}, which accounts among others for the fact that it is plural:
\emph{a hundred pages are/*is missing}. 
Its \textsc{marking} value is identified with that of \emph{a hundred} 
\iboxb{2}. This selects an unmarked plural nominal \iboxb{3} and 
since it is itself a head-functor phrase, its \textsc{head} value, which includes 
the \textsc{select} value, is shared with 
that of the numeral \emph{hundred} \iboxb{4} and its \textsc{marking} value 
with that of the article \iboxb{2}. Moreover, the article selects an unmarked 
singular nominal \iboxb{5}.
 
This treatment provides an account for the difference between 
the well-formed \emph{those two hundred pages} and the 
ill-formed *\emph{those a hundred pages}. The former is licensed since numerals 
like \emph{two} and \emph{hundred} are unmarked, while the latter is not, since 
the article is marked and since it shares that value with \emph{a hundred pages}.  


\subsubsection{The hierarchy of MARKING values} 
\label{sec-without-spec}


The distinction between marked and unmarked nominals in the functor treatment 
largely coincides with the distinction between nominals with an empty and a 
non-empty \textsc{spr} value in the specifier treatment. However, while  
the latter simply captures the difference between nominals with and without 
a determiner, the former can be used to capture finer-grained distinctions.  
To illustrate the need for such distinctions, 
let us take another look at the \ili{Dutch} attributive adjectives. 
As already pointed out in Section~\ref{sec-basics}, they take the  
affix \emph{-e} in combination with plural and singular non-neuter nominals, 
but not in combination with singular neuter nominals, as in \emph{zwart huis} 
`black house'.  
A complication, though, is that they also take the affix in singular neuter nominals 
if they are introduced by a definite determiner, as in \emph{het zwarte huis} `the black house'. 
This has consequences for the status of nominals with a singular neuter head: 
\emph{zwart huis} and \emph{zwarte huis}, for instance, are both unmarked, 
but put different constraints on the combination with a determiner. 
To model this, \citet[167]{VanEynde06} differentiates between two types 
of \type{unmarked} nominals, as shown in Figure~\ref{bare}. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{forest}
type hierarchy
[marking
  [unmarked
    [incomplete]
    [bare]]
  [marked]]		
\end{forest}
\caption{\label{bare} Hierarchy of \textsc{marking} values} 
\end{figure}

Employing the more specific subtypes, the adjectives without affix which select a singular 
neuter nominal have the \textsc{marking} value \type{bare}, while the adjectives with the affix
which select a singular neuter nominal have the value \type{incomplete}. 
Since this \textsc{marking} value is shared with the mother, the \textsc{marking} value 
of \emph{zwart huis} is \type{bare}, while that of \emph{zwarte huis} is \type{incomplete}. 
This interacts with the \textsc{select} value of the determiner. 
Non-definite determiners select a bare nominal, licensing \emph{een zwart huis}
`a black house', but not *\emph{een zwarte huis}.  
Definite determiners, by contrast, select an unmarked nominal, which implies that 
they are compatible with both bare and incomplete nominals, licensing 
both \emph{het zwarte huis} and \emph{het zwart huis}.\footnote{Normative grammars 
recommend the use of the form with the affix, but also point out that the form without affix 
is widely used, especially when the adjective forms a tight semantic unit with the noun.}
  
In a similar way, one can make finer-grained distinctions in the hierarchy of  
\type{marked} values to capture co-occurrence restrictions between determiners and 
nominals, as in the functor treatment of the \ili{Italian} determiner system of 
\citet{Allegranza06}. See also the treatment of nominals with idiosyncratic properties 
in Section~\ref{idio}. 


\subsection{Conclusion} 


This section has presented the three main treatments of nominal structures in HPSG. 
They are all surface-oriented and monostratal, and they are very similar in their 
treatment of the semantics of the nominals. 
The differences mainly concern the treatment of the determiners and the adjuncts. 
In terms of the dichotomy between NP and DP approaches, the specifier and the functor 
treatment side with the former, while the DP treatment sides with the latter. 
Overall, the NP treatments turn out to be more amenable to integration  
in a monostratal surface-oriented framework than the DP treatment; see also 
\citew{VanEynde2020}, \citew{MuellerHeadless}, and \citew{MyPM2021a}. Of the two NP treatments,
the specifier treatment is closer to early versions of X-bar theory and GPSG.   
The functor treatment is closer to versions of Categorial (Unification) Grammar, and 
has also been adopted in Sign-Based Construction Grammar \citep[155--157]{Sag2012}.

 

\section{Idiosyncratic nominals}
\label{idio}

\largerpage
This section focusses on the analysis of nominals with idiosyncratic properties. 
Since their analysis often requires a relaxation of the strictly lexicalist approach 
of early HPSG, I first introduce some basic notions of Constructional HPSG (Section~\ref{cohp}). 
Then I present analyses of nominals with a verbal core (Section~\ref{geru}), 
of the Big Mess Construction (Section~\ref{bime}) and of idiosyncratic P+NOM combinations 
(Section~\ref{prep}). Finally, we provide pointers to analyses of other nominals with 
idiosyncratic properties (Section~\ref{other}). 


\subsection{Constructional HPSG} 
\label{cohp}


The lexicalist approach of early HPSG can be characterized as one in which the 
properties of phrases are mainly determined by properties of the constituent words 
and only to a small extent by properties of the combinatory operations. 
\citet[391]{ps2}, for instance, employ no more than seven types 
of combinations, including those which were exemplified in Section~\ref{syns}, 
i.e.\ head-complements, head-adjunct and head-specifier.\footnote{The remaining four 
are head-subject, head-subject-complements, head-marker and head-filler.}   
Over time, though, this radical lexicalism gave way to an 
approach in which the properties of the combinatory operations  
play a larger role. The small inventory of highly abstract phrase types was
replaced by a finer-grained hierarchy in which the types can be associated with more specific 
and -- if need be -- idiosyncratic constraints. This development started in \citet{Sag97}, 
was elaborated in \citet{GS00}, and gained momentum afterward. 
Characteristic of Constructional HPSG is the use of a bidimensional hierarchy\is{type hierarchy} 
of phrasal signs. In such a hierarchy, the phrases are not only partitioned 
in terms of \textsc{headedness}, but also in terms of a second dimension, called  
\textsc{clausality}, as shown in Figure~\ref{bidim}. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{forest}
type hierarchy
[phrase
  [headedness,partition
    [headed-phrase
	[head-subject-phrase] 
	[\ldots]]
    [non-headed-phrase]]

    [clause
      [declarative-clause
        [decl-head-subj-cl, edge to=!PPP]] % draw an edge to the third leave preceeding this one (P P
                                % P). The first is non-headed-phr, then ..., then head-subj-phrase
        [\ldots]]
      [non-clause]]]
\end{forest}
\caption{\label{bidim} Bidimensional hierarchy of clauses}  
\end{figure}

The types in the \textsc{clausality} dimension are associated with constraints,
in much the same way as the types in the \textsc{headedness} dimension.  
Clauses, for instance, are required to denote an object of type \type{message} 
\citep[41]{GS00}.

\begin{exe}
\ex \emph{clause} \impl 
\avm{
[synsem|loc|content & message]
}
\end{exe}

\noindent
At a finer-grained level, clauses are partitioned into 
declarative, interrogative, imperative, exclamative and relative
clauses, each with their own constraints. 
Interrogative clauses, for instance, have a \textsc{content} value of type 
\type{question}, which is a subtype of \type{message}, and 
indicative declarative clauses have a \textsc{content} value of type 
\type{proposition}, which is another subtype of \type{message}.

Exploiting the possibilities of multiple inheritance, one can 
define types which inherit properties from more than one supertype. 
The type \type{declarative-head-subject-clause}, for instance, inherits 
the properties of \type{head-subject-phrase}, on the one hand, and 
\type{declarative-clause}, on the other hand. Additionally, it may 
have properties of its own, such as the fact that its head daughter 
is a finite verb \citep[43]{GS00}. 
This combination of multiple inheritance and specific   
constraints on maximal phrase types is also useful for the analysis of 
nominals with idiosyncratic properties, as will be shown in Sections~\ref{geru} 
and~\ref{bime}. 


\subsection{Nominals with a verbal core} 
\label{geru}


Ordinary nominals have a nominal core, but there are also nominals  
with a verbal core, such as gerunds and nominalized infinitives. They are 
of special interest, since they figure prominently in the argumentation 
that triggered the shift from the NP approach to the DP approach in Transformational 
Grammar. Some examples of gerunds are given in (\ref{gno}), 
quoted from \citet[1290]{Quirketal85}. 

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{gno}
\begin{xlist}
\ex\label{gen}  {}[Brown's deftly painting his daughter] is a delight to watch. 
\ex\label{np:ex-acc}  I dislike [Brown painting his daughter]. 
\ex\label{opt}  Brown is well known for [painting his daughter].
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\noindent
The bracketed phrases have the external distribution of an NP, 
taking the subject position in (\ref{gen}), 
the complement position of a transitive verb in (\ref{np:ex-acc}) and 
the complement position of a preposition in (\ref{opt}). 
The internal structure of these phrases, though, shows a mixture of nominal and verbal 
characteristics. 
Typically verbal are the presence of an NP complement in (\ref{gen})--(\ref{opt}), 
of an adverbial modifier in (\ref{gen}) and of an accusative subject in (\ref{np:ex-acc}). 
Typically nominal is the presence of the possessive in (\ref{gen}). 

To model this mixture of nominal and verbal properties \citet[65]{Malouf00} 
develops an analysis along the lines of the specifier treatment, in which 
the hierarchy of part-of-speech values is given more internal structure, as in 
Figure~\ref{ger}. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{forest}
type hierarchy
[part-of-speech
	[noun,calign=2 % align this node with the second child below = common-noun
		[proper-noun]
		[common-noun]
		[gerund]]
	[relational, calign=2 % align this node with the second child below = verb
                [,identify=!P] % The previous leaf is identical.
		[verb]
		[adjective]]]
\end{forest}
\caption{ \label{ger} The gerund as a mixed category }
\end{figure} 

Instead of treating \type{noun}, \type{verb}, \type{adjective}, etc. as 
immediate subtypes of \type{part-of-speech}, they are grouped in terms of 
intermediate types, such as \type{relational}, which subsumes (among others) verbs and adjectives, 
they are partitioned in terms of subtypes, such as \type{proper-noun}
and \type{common-noun}, and they are extended with types that inherit properties 
of more than one supertype, such as \type{gerund}, which is a subtype of both 
\type{noun} and \type{relational}. In addition to the inherited properties, the gerund has 
some properties of its own. These are spelled out in a lexical rule 
which derives gerunds from the homophonous present participles \citep[66]{Malouf00}.

\begin{exe}
\ex
Lexical rule for gerunds \citep[66]{Malouf00}:\\
% why do you add this? it just repeats what is already there in the immediately preceding text  
\avm{
[head &	[\type*{verb}
		vform & prp] \\
 subj  & < \1 np> \\
 comps & \2 \\
 spr & < >]
} $\mapsto$ %
% why do you change this? Malouf uses the double arrow
\avm{
[head & gerund \\
subj & < \1 > \\
comps & \2 \\
spr & < \1 >] 
}
\end{exe}

\noindent
This rule says that gerunds take the same complements 
as the present participles from which they are derived 
\iboxb{2}.
%\footnote{Boxed Roman capitals stand for objects of type \type{list}, 
%as in \citet{GS00} and \citet{SagWasow03}.}  
Their compatibility with adverbial modifiers follows from the 
fact that adverbs typically modify objects of type \type{relational},
which is a supertype of \type{gerund}. 
The availability of different options for realizing the subject is 
captured by the inclusion of the subject requirement of the present 
participle in both the \textsc{subj} list and the \textsc{spr} list of the gerund
\iboxb{1}. To model the two options, \citet[15]{Malouf00} employs the  
bidimensional hierarchy of phrase types in Figure~\ref{bido}. 

\begin{figure}

                                  % nonfin-head-subj-cxg, so we refer to this tier. 
    ]]
\end{forest}

\caption{\label{bido}Bidimensional hierarchy of gerundial phrases} 
\end{figure}

\largerpage[1.5]
The combination with an accusative subject is subsumed by \type{nonfin-head-subj-cx}, 
which is a subtype of \type{head-subject-phrase} and \type{clause}. 
Its defining properties are spelled out in (\ref{acccx}) 
\citep[16]{Malouf00}.\footnote{Malouf uses the feature {\sc non-hd-dtr} to single out
the non-head daughter.}  

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{acccx} 
\emph{nonfin-head-subj-cx} \impl \\
\avm{
[synsem|loc|category|head|root & -- \\
 \punk{non-hd-dtr|synsem|loc|category|head}{ [\type*{noun}
                                      case & acc]} ]  
}
\end{exe} 

\noindent
This construction type subsumes combinations of a non-finite head with 
an accusative subject, as in (\ref{np:ex-acc}). When the non-finite head is a gerund, 
the \textsc{head} value of the resulting clause is \type{gerund} 
and since that is a subtype of \type{noun}, the clause is also a nominal phrase. 
This accounts for the fact that its external distribution is that of an NP.  
By contrast, the combination with a possessive subject is subsumed by 
\type{noun-poss-cx}, which is a subtype of \type{head-specifier-phrase} and 
\type{non-clause} \citep[16]{Malouf00}.\footnote{Malouf treats 
the \ili{English} possessive as a genitive, unlike \citet[\page 199]{SagWasow03}; see
footnote~\ref{fn-possesive-s}.}

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{gencx} 
\type{noun-poss-cx} ~ \impl ~ 
\avm{
[synsem|loc &	[\punk{category|head}{ noun} \\
				content & scope-object] \\
\punk{non-hd-dtr|synsem|loc|category|head}{	[\type*{noun}
                                      		case & gen]} ] 
}
\end{exe}

\largerpage[1.5] 
\noindent
This construction subsumes combinations of a nominal and a 
possessive specifier, as in \emph{Brown's house}, and since 
\type{noun} is a supertype of \type{gerund},  
it also subsumes combinations with the gerund, as in (\ref{gen}). 

In sum, Malouf's analysis of the gerund involves a reorganization of the 
part-of-speech hierarchy, a lexical rule and the addition of two construction types.     



\subsection{The Big Mess Construction} 
\label{bime}  


In ordinary nominals, determiners precede attributive adjectives. Changing the order 
yields ill-formed combinations, such as *\emph{long that bridge} and *\emph{very tall every man}. 
However, this otherwise illegitimate order is precisely what is found in 
the Big Mess Construction (BMC), a term coined by \citet{Berman74}\addpages.  

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{bigme}
\begin{xlist}
\ex   It's [so good a bargain] I can't resist buying it.
\ex   {}[How serious a problem] is this?
\end{xlist}
\end{exe} 

\noindent
The idiosyncratic order in (\ref{bigme}) is required if the nominal is introduced 
by the indefinite article, and if the preceding AP is introduced by one of a small 
set of degree markers, including \emph{so, as, how, this, that} and \emph{too}. 


\subsubsection{A specifier treatment} 


A specifier treatment of the BMC is provided in \citet[201]{GS00}. It adopts  
a left branching structure, as in [[[\emph{so good}] \emph{a}] \emph{bargain}], 
in which \emph{so good} is the specifier of the indefinite article and in which 
\emph{so good a} is the specifier of \emph{bargain}. 
This is comparable to the treatment of the possessive in 
[[[\emph{the Queen of England}] \emph{'s}] \emph{sister}] in Section~\ref{phrsp}.  
However, while there is evidence that \emph{the Queen of England's} is a constituent,
since it may occur independently, as in (\ref{crown}), there is no evidence that 
\emph{so good a} is a constituent, as shown in (\ref{brgn}).

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{crown}  This crown is [the Queen of England's].
\ex\label{brgn}   That bargain is [so good (*a)]. 
\end{exe} 

\noindent
Instead, there is evidence that the article forms a constituent with the following noun, 
since it also precedes the noun when the AP is in postnominal position, as in (\ref{barga}). 

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{barga}  We never had [a bargain] [so good as this one].
\end{exe} 

\noindent
It is, hence, preferable to assign a structure in which the AP and the NP are sisters, as in  
[[\emph{so good}] [\emph{a bargain}]]. 


\subsubsection{A functor treatment} 


A structure in which the AP and the NP are sisters is adopted in 
\citet{VanEynde07}, \citet{KimSells11}, \citet{KaySag12}, 
\citet{ArnoldSadler14} and \citet{VanEynde18}, all of which are functor treatments. 
They also share the assumption that the combination is an NP and that its head daughter is 
the lower NP. The structure of the head daughter is spelled out in Figure~\ref{aprob}. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{forest}
sm edges
[%
{[\head \ibox{1} \type{noun}, \textsc{mark} \ibox{2} \type{a}]}
	[%
	{[\textsc{head|sel} \ibox{3}, \textsc{mark} \ibox{2}]}
		[a]
	]
	[%
	{\ibox{3} [\head \ibox{1}, \textsc{mark} \type{unmarked}]}
		[bargain]
	]
]
\end{forest}
\caption{\label{aprob} The NP \emph{a bargain}}
\end{figure}

The article has a \textsc{marking} value of type \type{a}, which is a subtype of \type{marked} and which it
shares with the mother.\footnote{The \textsc{marking} value of the article looks similar to its 
\textsc{phonology} value, but it is not the same. The \textsc{phonology} values of \emph{a} and \emph{an}, 
for instance, are different, but their \textsc{marking} value is not.} 

The AP is also treated as an instance of the head-functor type 
in \citet{VanEynde07}, \citet{KimSells11} and \citet{VanEynde18}. 
The adverb has a \textsc{marking} value of type \type{marked}, 
so that the AP is marked as well, as shown in Figure~\ref{sohow}.   

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{forest}
sm edges
[%
\avm{[head \ibox{3} \type{adj}, mark \ibox{1} \type{marked}]}
	[%
	\avm{[head|sel \ibox{2}, mark \ibox{1}]}
		[so]
	]
	[%
	\avm{\ibox{2} [head \ibox{3}, mark \type{unmarked}]}
		[good]
	]
]
\end{forest}
\caption{\label{sohow} The AP \emph{so good}}
\end{figure}

In combination with the fact that the article selects an unmarked nominal, 
this accounts for the ill-formedness of (\ref{ster}). 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ster}
\begin{xlist}
\ex   [*] {It's a so good bargain I can't resist buying it.} 
\ex   [*] {A how serious problem is it?}   
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\noindent
By contrast, adverbs like \emph{very} and \emph{extremely} are unmarked,
so that the APs which they introduce are admissible in this position, as in (\ref{st}).  

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{st}
\begin{xlist}
\ex  This is a very serious problem. 
\ex  We struck an extremely good bargain. 
\end{xlist} 
\end{exe} 

To model the combination of the AP with the lower NP, it may at first seem 
plausible to treat the AP as a functor which selects  
an NP that is introduced by the indefinite article. This, however, has 
unwanted consequences: given that \textsc{select} is a \textsc{head} feature, 
its value is shared between the AP and the adjective, so that the latter 
has the same \textsc{select} value as the AP, erroneously licensing such 
combinations as *\emph{good a bargain}. To avoid this, \citet{VanEynde18} models 
the combination in terms of a special type of phrase, called \type{big-mess-phrase}, 
whose place in the hierarchy of phrase types is defined in Figure~\ref{prot}.

\caption{ \label{prot}Bidimensional hierarchy of nominals} 
\end{figure}

The types in the \textsc{headedness} dimension are a subset of those in Figure~\ref{typ}.  
The types in the \textsc{clausality} dimension mainly capture semantic and 
category-specific properties, in analogy with the hierarchy of clausal phrases 
in \citet[\page 363]{GS00}. One of the non-clausal phrase types is \type{nominal-parameter}: 

\ea
\label{param} 
\emph{nominal-parameter} \impl\\
\avm{
[\punk{synsem|loc}{	[\punk{category|head}{ noun} \\
					content &	[\type*{parameter}
								index & \1 \\
								restr & \2 \cupAVM \3 ] ]} \\
 dtrs & <[synsem|loc|content|restr \2 ], \4> \\
 head-dtr & \4 [synsem|loc|content	[\type*{parameter} \\
                                    index & \1 \\
                                    restr & \3 ] ] ]
}
\z

\largerpage[2]
\noindent
The mother shares its index with the head daughter \iboxb{1} and 
its \textsc{restr(iction)} value is the union of the \textsc{restr} values 
of the daughters \iboxb{2} and \iboxb{3}. 
In the hierarchy of non-clausal phrases, this type contrasts among others with 
quantified nominals, which have a \textsc{content} value of type 
\type{quant-rel} \citep[203--205]{GS00}. A subtype of \type{nominal-parameter} is  
\type{intersective-modification}, as defined in (\ref{mononom}).

\ea
\label{mononom} 
\emph{intersective-modification} \impl\\
\avm{
[synsem|loc|content|index \1\smallskip\\
 dtrs  <[synsem|loc|content|index & \1 ], X > ]
}
\z
%\itdopt{Stefan: This means that the non-head daughter has to be the first daughter. I understood the DTRS
%  approach so that the oder corresponds to the surface order.}
%\itdopt{Frank: It is indeed the first daughter in English, and it is hence correct for the BMC.
%The surface order is in the PHON value.}

\noindent 
This constraint requires the mother to share its index also with the 
non-head daughter. It captures the intuition that the 
noun and its non-head sister apply to the same entities, as in 
the case of \emph{red box}.\footnote{Another subtype of \type{nominal-parameter} 
is \type{inverted-predication}, which subsumes 
the Binominal Noun Phrase Construction and certain types of apposition;
see Section~\ref{other}.}  

Maximal types inherit properties of one of the types of headed phrases
and of one of the non-clausal phrase types.  
Regular nominal phrases, for instance, such as \emph{red box}, are subsumed 
by a type, called \type{regular-nominal-phrase}, that inherits the 
constraints of \type{head-functor-phrase}, on the one hand, and 
\type{intersective-modification}, on the other hand.  
Another maximal type is \type{big-mess-phrase}. 
Its immediate supertype in the \textsc{clausality} hierarchy is the same 
as for the regular nominal phrases, i.e.\ \type{intersective-modification}, 
but the one in the \textsc{headedness} hierarchy is different: 
being a subtype of \type{head-independent-phrase}, 
its non-head daughter does not select the head daughter. Its \textsc{select} 
value is, hence, of type \type{none}. 
In addition to the inherited properties, the BMC has some properties of its own.   
They are spelled out in (\ref{bigmess2}).\is{schema!Big Mess}

\eas
\label{bigmess2}%
\type{big-mess-phrase} \impl \\

head-dtr &	\1 [\type*{regular-nominal-phrase}
           	synsem|loc|category|marking & a] ]
}
\zs

\largerpage[2]
\noindent
The head daughter is required to be a regular nominal phrase 
whose \textsc{marking} value is of type \type{a}, and the other daughter 
is required to be an adjectival head-functor phrase
with a \textsc{marking} value of type \type{marked}. 
This licenses APs which are introduced by a marked adverb, 
as in \emph{so good a bargain} and \emph{how serious a problem}, 
while it excludes unmarked APs, as in 
*\emph{good a bargain} and *\emph{very big a house}.
Iterative application is not licensed, since (\ref{bigmess2}) requires the 
head daughter to be of type \type{regular-nominal-phrase}, which is incompatible with the type 
\type{big-mess-phrase}. This accounts for the fact that a big
mess phrase cannot contain another big mess phrase, as in
*\emph{that splendid so good a bargain}.

A reviewer remarked that this analysis allows combinations like 
\emph{so big an expensive red house}, suggesting that it should not. 
It is not certain, though, that this combination is ill-formed.
Notice, for instance, that the sentences in (\ref{shrub}), 
quoted from \citet[116]{Zwicky95} and \citet[42]{Troseth09} respectively, 
are well-formed. 

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{shrub} 
\begin{xlist} 
\ex  How big a new shrub from France were you thinking of buying? 
\ex  That's as beautiful a little black dress as I've ever seen.  
\end{xlist} 
\end{exe} 

In sum, the analysis of the Big Mess Phrase involves the addition of 
a type to the bidimensional hierarchy of phrase types, whose properties 
are partly inherited from its supertypes and partly idiosyncratic.      


\subsection{Idiosyncratic P+NOM combinations} 
\label{prep}


When an ordinary nominal combines with a preposition, the result is a PP. 
The \ili{French} \emph{de} `of', for instance, heads a PP in 
\emph{je viens de Roubaix} `I come from Roubaix'. 
In \emph{beaucoup de farine} `much flour', by contrast, \emph{de} has 
a rather different role, as argued in \citet{Abeilleetal04}. 
Similar contrasts are found in other languages. The \ili{English} \emph{of}, for instance, 
heads a PP in \emph{the dog of the neighbors}, but its role in \emph{these sort of problems} 
is rather different, as argued in \citet{Maekawa15}.  


\subsubsection{A specifier treatment} 

\largerpage
In their specifier treatment of \emph{beaucoup de farine} `much flour',  
\citet{Abeilleetal04} treat \emph{de} as a weak head. 
Typical of a weak head is that it shares 
nearly all properties of its complement, as spelled out in (\ref{de}).

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{de} 
\avm{
[category &	[head & \1 \\
           	subj & \2 \\
           	spr & \3 \\
           	comps & <[category &	[head & \1 \\
									subj & \2 \\
									spr  & \3 \\
									comps & < > \\
									marking & unmarked] \\
					content & \4 ]> \\
			marking & de ] \\
 content & \4 ] 
}
\end{exe} 

\noindent
\emph{de} has the same values for \textsc{head}, \textsc{subj}, \textsc{spr} and 
\textsc{content} as its nominal complement. 
The only difference concerns the \textsc{marking} value: \emph{de} requires an 
unmarked complement, but its own \textsc{marking} value is of type \emph{de}. 
Since it shares this \textsc{marking} value with the mother, the latter is 
compatible with specifiers that require a nominal that is introduced by \emph{de}, 
such as \emph{beaucoup} `much'/`many', whose lexical entry is given in 
(\ref{coup}).\footnote{In this entry, quoted from \citet[18]{Abeilleetal04}, 
the value of \textsc{spec} is of type \type{synsem}, as in \citet[\page 45]{ps2}, and not of type 
\type{semantic-object}, as in \citet[\page 362]{GS00}.}

}
\end{exe} 

\noindent
The selected nominal is required to be unsaturated for \textsc{spr} and to have a 
\textsc{marking} value of type \type{de}. \emph{Beaucoup} is treated as an adverb that  
shares the index and the restrictions of its nominal head sister. Conversely, the nominal
also selects its specifier via its \textsc{spr} value, following the mutual 
selection regime of the specifier treatment; see Section~\ref{semco}.


\subsubsection{A functor treatment} 

\largerpage
In a functor treatment of \emph{beaucoup de farine} `much flour', \emph{de} and 
\emph{beaucoup} are both functors. The preposition selects a nominal of type \type{bare} and 
has a \textsc{marking} value of \type{de} which it shares with the mother. 
The quantifier \emph{beaucoup} selects a nominal with the \textsc{marking} value 
\type{de} and has a \textsc{marking} value of type \type{marked} which it 
shares with the NP as a whole, as spelled out in Figure~\ref{beau}.

\begin{figure}

			[farine;flour]
		]
	]
]
\end{forest}}
\caption{\label{beau} An adverbial functor and a prepositional functor}
\end{figure}

Since the noun is the head daughter of \emph{de farine}, the 
part-of-speech, valence and meaning of \emph{de farine} 
are shared directly with \emph{farine}, 
rather than via the entry for \emph{de}, as in the weak head treatment. 

Comparing the functor treatment with the weak head treatment,  
a major difference concerns the status of \emph{de}. In the former it is 
uniformly treated as a semantically vacuous preposition; in the latter it shares 
the part-of-speech and \textsc{content} value of its complement, so that it is 
a noun with a \textsc{content} value of type \type{scope-object} in 
\emph{beaucoup de farine} and a verb with a \textsc{content} value of type 
\type{state-of-affairs} in (\ref{sorti}), where it takes 
an infinitival VP as its complement.   

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{sorti}   
\gll   De sortir un peu te ferait du bien.  \\
       to go.out a bit you would.do of.the good \\\hfill(French)
\trans `Going out a bit would do you some good.'
\end{exe}  

\noindent
In some cases, this sharing leads to analyses that are empirically implausible. 
An example is discussed in \citet{Maekawa15}, who provides  
an analysis of \ili{English} nominals of the \emph{kind}/\emph{type}/\emph{sort} variety.  
A typical property of these nominals is that the determiner may show agreement with the 
rightmost noun, as in \emph{these sort of problems} and \emph{those kind of pitch changes},
rather than with the noun that it immediately precedes. 
To model this Maekawa considers the option of treating \emph{of} and the immediately 
preceding noun as weak heads, but dismisses it, since it has the unwanted effect of treating 
\emph{kind}/\emph{type}/\emph{sort} as plural. 
As an alternative, he develops an analysis in which \emph{of} and 
the preceding noun are functors \citep[149]{Maekawa15}. This yields a plural nominal, but 
without the side-effect of treating \emph{kind}/\emph{type}/\emph{sort} as plural. 


\subsection{Other nominals with idiosyncratic properties} 
\label{other}

\largerpage
There are many more types of nominals with idiosyncratic properties
that I cannot fully survey here. 
Instead, I mention some that have been analyzed in HPSG terms and add pointers 
to the relevant literature.    

A much-studied nominal with idiosyncratic properties is the Binominal Noun Phrase 
Construction (BNPC), exemplified in (\ref{climb}). 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{climb}
\begin{xlist}
\ex  She blames it on [her nitwit of a husband]. 
\ex  She had [a skullcracker of a headache]. 
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\noindent
In contrast to ordinary [NP--\emph{of}--NP] sequences, 
as in \emph{the dog of my neighbor}, where the 
first nominal is the head of the entire NP, and where the second 
nominal is part of its PP adjunct, 
the relation between the nominals is a predicative one in the BNPC: 
her husband is claimed to be a nitwit, and the headache is claimed to be 
like a skullcracker. HPSG treatments of the BNPC are provided in
\citet{KimSells14} and \citet{VanEynde18}. The latter extends 
the phrase type hierarchy in Figure~\ref{prot}, defining the BNPC as 
a maximal type that inherits from \type{head-independent-phrase} and 
\type{inverted-predication}. To capture the intuition that the second
nominal is the head of the entire NP, the preposition \emph{of} is 
treated as a functor that selects a nominal head, as in Maekawa's treatment of 
the preposition in \emph{these sort of problems}; see Section~\ref{prep}. 

Another special kind of nominals is apposition. It comes in (at least) two types, known as 
close apposition and loose apposition. Relevant examples are given in (\ref{appo}). 

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{appo} 
\begin{xlist} 
\ex  {}[My brother Richard] is a soldier.  
\ex  {}[Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia,] is where WWI began.
\end{xlist} 
\end{exe}

\noindent
Both types are compared and analyzed in \citet{Kim12} and \citet{Kim14}. 
\citet{VanEyndeKim16} provides an analysis of loose apposition in the 
Sign-Based Construction Grammar framework. 

Comparable to the nominals with a verbal core, such as gerunds and nominalized 
infinitives, are nominals with an adjectival core, as in \emph{the very poor} and 
\emph{the merely skeptical}. They are described and given an HPSG analysis 
in \citet{ArnoldSpencer2015}.

Idiosyncratic are also the nominals with an extracted \emph{wh}-word, as in 
the \ili{French} (\ref{combi}) and the \ili{Dutch} (\ref{gelu}). 

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{combi}  
\gll   Combien as-tu lu [~\trace{} de livres en latin]?  \\
       how.many have-you read {} of books in Latin  \\\hfill(French)
\trans `How many books have you read in Latin?' 
\ex\label{gelu}
\gll   Wat zijn dat [~\trace{} voor vreemde geluiden]? \\
       what are that {} for strange noises        \\\hfill(Dutch)
\trans `What kind of strange noises are those?'  
\end{exe} 

\largerpage
\noindent
The \ili{French} example is analyzed in \citet[20--21]{Abeilleetal04} and the \ili{Dutch} one in 
\citet[47--50]{VanEynde04}. Other kinds of discontinuous NPs are treated in \citet{deKuthy2002a}. 

While all of the above are idiosyncratic in at least one respect, opinions diverge about 
predicative nominals. They are claimed to be special by \citet[409]{GS00}, who 
employ a lexical rule mapping nominal lexemes onto predicative nouns and 
extending their valence with an unexpressed subject that is identified with an argument of the 
predicate selecting verb. In (\ref{lesl}), for instance, \emph{Leslie} is treated as the subject 
of \emph{sister}, and the copula as a semantically vacuous subject raising 
verb.\footnote{\citet[225]{MuellerPredication} also extends the valence with an unexpressed subject, 
but models this in terms of a non-branching phrasal projection, rather than by a lexical rule.}   

\begin{exe} 
\ex\label{lesl}   Leslie is my sister. 
\end{exe} 
   
\noindent
Alternatively, \citet[158--163]{VanEynde15} treats the copula as a relation that assigns the \textsc{theme} 
role to its subject and the \textsc{attribute} role to its predicative complement. In that analysis, 
predicative nominals are treated along the same lines as ordinary nominals.  
  

\section{Conclusion} 


This chapter has provided a survey of how nominals are analyzed in HPSG. 
Over time three treatments have taken shape: the specifier treatment, 
the DP treatment and the functor treatment. 
Each was presented and applied to ordinary nominals in Section~\ref{ordi}. 
A comparison showed that treatments that adopt the NP approach fit in better with 
the surface-oriented monostratal character of HPSG than the DP treatment does.
I then turned to nominals with idiosyncratic properties in Section~\ref{idio}.
Since their analysis often requires a relaxation of the strictly lexicalist stance of early HPSG, 
I first introduced some basic notions of Constructional HPSG and then applied these notions to 
such idiosyncratic nominals as the gerund, the Big Mess Construction and irregular P+NOM combinations.  
Some of these analyses adopt the specifier treatment, others the functor treatment. 
When both are available, as in the case of the Big Mess Construction and  
irregular P+NOM combinations, the functor treatment seems more plausible. 
Finally, I have added pointers to relevant literature for other nominals with idiosyncratic properties,
such as the Binominal Noun Phrase Construction, apposition, nominals with an adjectival core  
and discontinuous NPs.

For their comments on earlier versions of this chapter I would like to thank 
Liesbeth Augustinus, two anonymous reviewers and the editors of the handbook.  
My contributions to the HPSG framework span nearly three decades now, 
starting with work on a EU-financed project to which Valerio Allegranza, 
Doug Arnold and Louisa Sadler also contributed \citep{VanEyndeSchmidt98}. 
Beside the EU-funding it was conversations with Dani\`ele Godard and Ivan Sag 
that convinced me of the merits and potential of HPSG.  
I became a regular at the annual HPSG conferences by 1998 and started teaching it in Leuven around 
the same time. A heart-felt thanks goes to the colleagues who over the years have created such a stimulating
environment to work in.
