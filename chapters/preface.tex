Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) is a declarative (or, as is often said,
constraint-based) monostratal approach to grammar which dates back to early 1985, when Carl Pollard
presented his Lectures on HPSG. It was developed initially in joint work by Pollard and Ivan Sag,
but many other people have made important contributions to its development over the decades. It
provides a framework for the formulation and implementation of natural language grammars which are
(i) linguistically motivated, (ii) formally explicit, and (iii) computationally tractable. From the
very beginning it has involved both theoretical and computational work seeking both to address the
theoretical concerns of linguists and the practical issues involved in building a useful natural
language processing system.

HPSG is an eclectic framework which has drawn ideas from the earlier Generalized Phrase Structure
Grammar (GPSG, \citealp{GKPS85a}), Categorial Grammar \citep{Ajdukiewicz35a-u}, and Lexical"=Functional
Grammar (LFG, \citealp{Bresnan82a-ed}), among others. It has naturally evolved over the decades. Thus, the construction"=based version of
HPSG, which emerged in the mid-1990s \citep{Sag97a,GSag2000a-u}, differs from earlier work
\citep{ps,ps2} in employing complex hierarchies of phrase types or
constructions. Similarly, the more recent Sign-Based Construction Grammar approach differs from
earlier versions of HPSG in making a distinction between signs and constructions and using it to make a
number of simplifications \citep{Sag2012a}.

Over the years, there have been groups of HPSG researchers in many locations engaged in both
descriptive and theoretical work and often in building HPSG-based computational systems. There have
also been various research and teaching networks, and an annual conference since 1993. The result of
this work is a rich and varied body of research focusing on a variety of languages and offering a
variety of insights. The present volume seeks to provide a picture of where HPSG is today. It begins
with a number of introductory chapters dealing with various general issues. These are followed by
chapters outlining HPSG ideas about some of the most important syntactic phenomena. Next are a
series of chapters on other levels of description, and then chapters on other areas of
linguistics. A final group of chapters considers the relation between HPSG and other theoretical
frameworks.

It should be noted that for various reasons not all areas of HPSG research are covered in the
handbook (e.g., phonology). So, the fact that a particular topic is not addressed in the handbook
should not be interpreted as an absence of research on the topic. Readers interested in such topics
can refer to the HPSG online bibliography maintained at the Humboldt Universität zu Berlin.\footnote{%

All chapters were reviewed by one author and at least one of the editors. All chapters were reviewed
by Stefan Müller. Jean-Pierre Koenig and Stefan Müller did a final round of reading all papers and
checked for consistency and cross-linking between the chapters.


\section*{Open access}


Many authors of this handbook have previously been involved in several other handbook projects (some that cover various aspects of HPSG), and by now there are at least five handbook articles on HPSG available. But the editors felt that writing one authoritative resource describing the framework and being available free of charge to everybody was an important service to the linguistic community. We hence decided to publish the book open access with Language Science Press.

Since the book is freely available and no commercial interests stand in the way of openness, the \LaTeX\ source code of the book can be made available as well.
We put all relevant files on GitHub,\footnote{
\url{https://www.github.com/langsci/259}, 2024-10-17.
} and we hope that they may serve as a role model for future publications of HPSG papers.
Additionally, every single item in the bibliographies was checked by hand either by Stefan Müller or by one of his student assistants. 
We checked authors and editors; made sure first name information was complete; corrected page numbers; removed duplicate entries; added DOIs and URLs where appropriate; and added series and number information as applicable for books, book chapters, and journal issues.
The result is a resource containing 2623 bibliography entries.
These can be downloaded as a single readable PDF file or as \textsc{Bib}\TeX{} file from \url{https://github.com/langsci/hpsg-handbook-bib}.
