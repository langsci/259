\section*{Foreword of the second edition}

\largerpage
The second edition comes with a lot of small improvements: the index has been improved, typos have
been fixed, reference were added, and ORCIDs were added to authors and are displayed on the title pages of the papers now.

%1 properties
The type in the example (\ref{ex:prop38})
on p.\,\pageref{ex:prop38} was changed from \type{phrase} to \type{example-type}. As noted by
Philipp Trapp in 2022, the presence of the feature \textsc{head-daughter} would entail that the type
of the AVM is \type{headed-phrase} and since the type implication in (\ref{ex:prop38}) applies to all
structures of type \type{phrase} this would mean that all linguistics objects of type \type{phrase} have to be
of type \type{headed-phrase}, which would result in contradictions for all subtypes of \emph{phrase}
that are not of type \type{headed-phrase}.

%2 evolution
The LILOG system is now mentioned in the chapter about the evolution of HPSG (Section~\ref{sec-LILOG}).

%4 lexicon
The argument realization principle in (\ref{wd-bouma}) on p.\,\pageref{wd-bouma} was fixed. It
contained too many brackets in the specification of the \depsl. Footnote~\ref{fn-subject-ARP} was
added to explain how constraints on the length of the \subjl can be enforced.

%6 agreement
% 04.09.2004
Example (\ref{ex-gender-agreement-historical-development}) on
p.\,\pageref{ex-gender-agreement-historical-development} was modified so that the respective
examples for historical stages of development of gender agreement are more similar.

%7 case
The example (\ref{ex:syn:gfr}) on p.\,\pageref{ex:syn:gfr} was changed to another example excluding the possibility that we
are dealing with an instance of non-matching free relative clauses.

%9 arg-st
Footnote~\ref{fn-mapsto-lexical-rules} was added on p.\,\pageref{fn-mapsto-lexical-rules} to explain
the lexical rule notation using $\mapsto$ that was employed later in the chapter. 
%The type \type{ppro} was explained.

%10 order
The relation \texttt{synsems2signs} was explained by adding (\ref{ex-schema-hc-flat-synsem-sign}),
which is an expansion of (\ref{schema-hc-flat}) on p.\,\pageref{schema-hc-flat}. The relation that
is used in the chapter on complex predicates has the same name now (see
(\ref{CP-ex-head-complements-phrase}) on p.\,\pageref{CP-ex-head-complements-phrase}). The
footnote~\ref{fn-order-lexical-Uszkoreit} was added. It discusses a lexical account of constituent
order assuming a separate lexical item for each ordering variant.

%14 relative clauses
Relative pronouns are NPs. The respective representation in (\ref{x:rc-18}) on p.\,\pageref{x:rc-18}
was fixed. Valence features were added to the lexical item in (\ref{x:rc-17}).

%16 coordination
\emph{Mary} is of category NP rather than N in Figure~\ref{coordphr} on p.\,\pageref{coordphr}. 

%17 idioms
There was an NP to many in the \compsl in the lexical item in (\ref{le-idiomatic-spill}) on
p.\,\pageref{le-idiomatic-spill}.


%Diff-lists are now explained A bit of explanation and a reference was added to
