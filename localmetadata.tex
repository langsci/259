\BackBody{Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) is a linguistic framework that models
  linguistic knowledge on all descriptive levels (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics,
  pragmatics) by using feature value pairs, structure sharing, and relational constraints. This
  volume summarizes work that has been done since the mid 80s. Various chapters discus formal foundations and
  basic assumptions, describe the evolution of the framework and go into the details of various
  syntactic phenomena. Separate chapters are devoted to non-syntactic levels of description. The
  book also handles related fields and research areas (gesture, sign languages, computational
  linguistics) and has a part in which HPSG is compared to other frameworks (Lexical Functional
  Grammar, Categorial Grammar, Construction Grammar, Dependency Grammar and Minimalim).
