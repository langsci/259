\title{Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar}
\subtitle{The handbook}
\BackBody{Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) is a linguistic framework that models   linguistic knowledge on all descriptive levels (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics,   pragmatics) by using feature value pairs, structure sharing, and relational constraints. This   volume summarizes work that has been done since the mid 80s. Various chapters discus formal foundations and   basic assumptions, describe the evolution of the framework and go into the details of various   syntactic phenomena. Separate chapters are devoted to non-syntactic levels of description. The book also handles related fields and research areas (gesture, sign languages, computational   linguistics) and has a part in which HPSG is compared to other frameworks (Lexical Functional   Grammar, Categorial Grammar, Construction Grammar, Dependency Grammar and Minimalim).
